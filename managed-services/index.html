Due to the increasing prevalence of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on organisational networks, businesses need to ensure that they have resilient protection in place in order to ensure that their companies do not suffer detrimentally from reputational damage or financial losses as a result of downtime.

                                    <p class="lead">
The size and velocity of these attacks is expected to grow exponentially with recent research revealing that there has been a 350 per cent increase in the number of large scale DDoS attacks taking place on corporate networks each year with typical downtime lasting six hours.
